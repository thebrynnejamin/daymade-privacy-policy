Daymade Privacy Policy

Effective Date: February 13th, 2026

Daymade (“the App”) is a productivity application designed to help users plan their day and reduce distractions using scheduled focus sessions.

Your privacy is important. This policy explains what information the App handles and how it is used.

Daymade does not transmit your task data to external servers.

3. Required Permissions

To provide the Focus Lock feature, Daymade may request the following permissions:

Usage Access Permission

Usage Access allows the App to detect when a selected blocked application is opened. This is required to enforce Focus Lock sessions and prevent access to distracting apps during scheduled focus periods.

This permission is only used to determine whether a blocked app has been opened while Focus Lock is active.

Overlay (Draw Over Other Apps) Permission

Overlay permission allows Daymade to display a blocking screen when a user attempts to open a blocked application during an active Focus Lock session.

This permission is used solely to enforce user-enabled focus sessions.

Daymade:

Does not sell your personal data.

Does not share your task data with third parties.

Does not use your data for advertising purposes.

5. Analytics and Tracking

Daymade does not collect personal data for analytics or tracking purposes.

If analytics features are added in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
